# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server (Cloudflare workerd runtime via `astro dev`)
- `npm run build` — production build (SSR via `@astrojs/cloudflare`)
- `npm run preview` — preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with type-checked rules
- `npm run lint:fix` — auto-fix lint issues
- `npm run format` — Prettier (includes `prettier-plugin-astro` and `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`)

Pre-commit: husky + lint-staged runs `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` and `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lint + build on every push/PR to `main`.

## Architecture

**Astro 6 SSR app** with React 19 islands, Tailwind CSS 4, and shadcn/ui. Deployed to Cloudflare Workers via `@astrojs/cloudflare`.

### Rendering

`output: "server"` in `astro.config.mjs` — all pages server-rendered by default. API routes must export `const prerender = false` (already the Astro SSR default for API routes, but required if you ever override at page level).

### Auth & data

No authentication. This is a single-user, local-only tool: the user opens the app and is immediately in, and all data lives on the user's device (no auth, no server-side user data, no Supabase). There is no request middleware and no protected routes — the landing page (`src/pages/index.astro`) is the tool itself.

### Key conventions

- **Path alias**: `@/*` → `./src/*` (tsconfig paths). Always use this alias, never relative imports crossing directory boundaries.
- **Component split**: Astro components for static content/layout; React components only when interactivity is needed.
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: configured via `@tailwindcss/vite` Vite plugin — no `tailwind.config.*` file. Theme customizations and base styles go in `src/styles/global.css`.
- **Class merging**: use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` (clsx + tailwind-merge). Never concatenate Tailwind class strings manually.
- **shadcn/ui**: components in `src/components/ui/`, "new-york" variant. Add new ones with `npx shadcn@latest add [name]`.
- **API routes**: export uppercase `GET`, `POST`, etc. Validate input with zod.
- **React**: no Next.js directives (`"use client"` etc.). Extract hooks to `src/components/hooks/`.
- **Services/helpers**: `src/lib/` (or `src/lib/services/` for business logic). Shared types (entities, DTOs) in `src/types.ts`.

### Environment

- Node.js v22.14.0 (`.nvmrc`)
- No runtime environment variables or external services — the app is fully local/on-device.
- Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy`

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 3

Review AI-generated code before merge with the **implementation review chain**:

```
/10x-implement -> /10x-impl-review -> triage -> (/10x-lesson | fix | skip | disagree)
```

`/10x-impl-review` is the lesson focus. Review is a quality gate, not an instruction to fix every finding.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code review (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-impl-review <change-id>` | You have implemented code and want a structured review before merge. The skill checks plan adherence, scope discipline, safety and quality, architecture, pattern consistency, and success criteria, then presents findings for triage. |
| **Recurring lesson outcome** | |
| `/10x-lesson` | A finding reveals a recurring project rule or agent failure pattern. Record it in `context/foundation/lessons.md` instead of treating it as a one-off note. |

### Triage discipline

- Severity says how bad the finding is. Impact says how much the decision matters now.
- Valid outcomes: fix now, fix differently, skip, accept as risk, record as recurring rule (`/10x-lesson`), disagree.
- Fix critical findings. Do not burn hours on low-impact observations just because the agent found them.
- Conscious skipping of low-impact findings is a valid review outcome, not negligence.
- If you disagree with a finding, record why. Wrong agent reasoning is also signal.

### Review boundaries

- This lesson reviews implemented code. It does not create the plan, execute new phases, or teach CI review.
- Testing strategy and quality gates are introduced in Module 3.
- Do not use `/10x-contract` as a triage outcome in this lesson.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - expected implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/reviews/` - review output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring lessons

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
